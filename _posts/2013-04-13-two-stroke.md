> I have had people tell me that the future of power for RC airplanes lies with electric motors or gasoline engines. But I find that two stroke nitro engines are still a very effecient, reliable, and inexpensive way to fly medium sized planes. A sport flyer would be remiss not to conside two stroke notro engines for power. Listed here are a number of preowned new and used options that might interest you.
